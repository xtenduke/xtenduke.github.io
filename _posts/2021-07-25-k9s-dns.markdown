Recently, I have 'discovered' DNS lookup issues from pods in K3S on my Raspberry Pi cluster.\
It seems that some pods on the same node, seemingly at random have DNS lookup issues, although DNS on the host works just fine.\
A host restart of the Node with the problem usually resolves the issue, but i'd rather get to the bottom of it.

Node (pi0)
```
<<K9s-Shell>> Pod: default/defiant-defiant-kube-5768879777-6gxv8 | Container: defiant-kube 
/app # nslookup defiant-defiant-kube.default.svc.cluster.local
;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached

/app # nslookup google.com
;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached

/app # 
```

Host (pi0)
```

"no servers could be reached"\
For some reason, Nodes can't reach the node-local DNS server.

**Known issue?**\
Multiple users of K3s have reported this, and it seems that it is a kernel or distro issue, see\
<https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/issues/3624> and
<https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/issues/1527>

**Temporary fix**\
 Configuring flannel (the container network interface used by k9s) to use `host-gw`\
 The drawback to `host-gw` as the backend is that it requires layer2 connection between all nodes. as documented [here](https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/blob/master/Documentation/backends.md)\
 This isn't a problem for my deployment as they are all connected to the same switch.
