Nvidia drivers on my Fedora 38 machine stopped working after an update, my usual debugging steps didn't work.
Symptoms were choppy rendering and high gnome-shell cpu usage, huh.. 

So I ran `nvidia-smi` to see what was going on

```
 $ nvidia-smi
 Failed to initialize NVML: Driver/library version mismatch
 NVML library version: 535.54
```

Weird, i'm not that familiar with nvidia driver packages, I assume something's been overwritten / a partial update has occurred. Time to reinstall akmod-nvidia and reboot.

```
 $ sudo dnf reinstall akmod-nvidia
 ...
 # reboot... 
```

Still no luck, lets make sure that the nvidia kernel modules are loaded

```
 $ lsmod | grep nvidia
nvidia_drm             94208  13
nvidia_modeset       1560576  18 nvidia_drm
nvidia_uvm           3493888  0
nvidia              62517248  978 nvidia_uvm,nvidia_modeset
video                  73728  2 asus_wmi,nvidia_modeset
```

Looks fine, check dmesg for issues?

```
 $ sudo dmesg | grep nvidia
```

And I found this

```
[   34.453610] NVRM: API mismatch: the client has the version 535.54.03, but
               NVRM: this kernel module has the version 530.41.03.  Please
               NVRM: make sure that this kernel module and all NVIDIA driver
               NVRM: components have the same version.
```

Not really sure what NVRM is, but I assume it's part of nVidia driver or cuda libs, so I reinstalled the driver, and the cuda package to no avail...

It seems NVRM is closely related to the nvidia kernel module, lets rebuild the initramfs and reboot.

```
 $ sudo dracut -f
```

Success! After rebuilding initramfs and rebooting, I have HW acceleration back, and nvidia-smi is reporting.

```
$ nvidia-smi
