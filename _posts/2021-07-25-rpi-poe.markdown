For those who want to run Ubuntu64 bit distros and not the "beta" 64 bit distro of raspbian on their PI4 with POE+ Hat\
Unfortunately, the new POE+ hat fan does not work OOB in Ubuntu 21.04 (and probably in prior versions).\
Fortunately it is trivial to enable

**Verify you have no entry in** `$ cat /sys/class/thermal/cooling_device0/type`\
If you get back
`rpi-poe-fan`\
you can skip to editing the firmware config file

**Make sure all packages are up to date**\
`$ apt update && apt upgrade`\
reboot the pi

**Install raspi-config package and raspi lib**\
`$ apt install libraspberrypi-bin raspi-config`

**Run the raspi-config binary**\
`$ raspi-config`\
select `Interface Options`\
enable the I2c module\
reboot the pi

**Add the following to the firmware config file** `/boot/firmware/config.txt`\
It should be pre-popuated by many other config lines (by raspi-config)
```
# fan
dtoverlay=rpi-poe
dtparam=poe_fan_temp0=80000,poe_fan_temp0_hyst=2000
dtparam=poe_fan_temp1=78000,poe_fan_temp1_hyst=5000
dtparam=poe_fan_temp2=73000,poe_fan_temp2_hyst=3000
dtparam=poe_fan_temp3=70000,poe_fan_temp3_hyst=5000

```

You can now reboot your system, the fan should kick in at 70 degrees celsius
